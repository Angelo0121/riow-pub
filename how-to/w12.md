# Week 12 Code along
You need to code along starting with video 84 and ending with 87 in section 9 of the The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp

# Video 84
Watch and code along!  REMEMBER use strict equality '===' and don't use '==', once you are done commit with message "Video 84 Code"

# Video 85
Watch and code along!  Can you see other uses of the try catch??  Watch to the point of understanding the challenge then stop and attempt the challenge in the gradeCalc code, once you have working code or watch to move on commit with message "Video 85 My Code", then watch the solution and update your code as needed. 

So can we think of the throw Error as a return???  

# Video 86
Watch and code along! Did you get why it makes sense to use the try catch in the retreive of local storage?

# Video 87
Watch and code along!  Let's all use 'use strict' going forward!  Yes that includes dev_1
